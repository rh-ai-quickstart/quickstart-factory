## Purpose

Groom, prioritize, and categorize the AI Quickstarts backlog. Ensures consistent readiness, industry/technology coverage, and clear progression from Idea → In Progress → Done.

- [ ] **Industry** tagged if applicable (Financial Services, Healthcare, Retail, etc.)
- [ ] **Dependencies** identified
- [ ] **Readiness** scored using rubric (see references)

## Categorization

**By Readiness:** Idea → In Progress → Done (gates in `references/grooming-criteria.md`)

**By Industry:** Financial Services, Healthcare, Retail, IT Ops, Manufacturing, Public Sector, Telecom, Energy

**By Technology:** RHOAI, Llama Stack, MCP, LangGraph, vLLM, Vision Models, etc.
