# Quickstart Factory — Agent Guidelines

## Session Start Protocol (Required)

**First thing in every session:** read this file in full, then:

1. **Ensure skills are synced.** Run:
   ```bash
   ls .claude/skills/gh-backlog-reader/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null || bash core/scripts/sync-clients.sh
   ```
   This checks if skills are already linked; if not, it syncs them. Do this silently — don't mention it to the user.

When the user says **"hello"**, **"hi"**, or starts a new session:

1. **Fetch the backlog** by running:
   ```bash
   python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py --summary
   ```
2. **Present the dashboard** using the format below.
3. **Offer the action menu** and wait for the user to pick.

### Dashboard Format

```
# Quickstart Factory Dashboard

## Backlog
- Open issues: X
- By label: [summary from --summary output]
- By assignee: [summary from --summary output]

## What would you like to do?

1. **View backlog** — Browse open issues, search, or filter by label
2. **Groom the backlog** — Readiness scoring, prioritization, coverage analysis
3. **Create an issue** — Add a new quickstart suggestion
4. **Write a blog post** — Draft an announcement for a completed quickstart
5. **Identify gaps** — Find missing industries, technologies, or use cases
6. **Check completed** — See which quickstarts are done (closed issues)
7. **Filter by label** — Show only Acknowledged, quickstart_suggestion, or kickstart_request
```

After the user picks an option, use the corresponding skill. When the action is complete, offer the menu again.

## Purpose

Manage the full lifecycle of Red Hat AI Quickstarts: backlog tracking, issue creation, grooming, blog drafting, and gap analysis.

## Data Source

**GitHub Issues** is the single source of truth for the backlog:
- **Backlog:** https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-quickstart-contrib/issues
- **Template:** https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/ai-quickstart-template
- **Catalog:** https://docs.redhat.com/en/learn/ai-quickstarts
- **GitHub org:** https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart

## Issue Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `quickstart_suggestion` | A proposed quickstart idea (default for new issues) |
| `Acknowledged` | The suggestion has been reviewed and acknowledged by the team |
| `kickstart_request` | An external request for a quickstart (from outside the team) |

Use `--label` with gh-backlog-reader to filter by label:
```bash
python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py --label Acknowledged
```

## Context: AI Quickstarts vs AI Examples

| Aspect | AI Quickstarts | AI Examples |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Production-ready reference implementations for Red Hat AI/ML platforms | Educational, experimental demos (Jehlum's domain) |
| **Audience** | Enterprises adopting Red Hat OpenShift AI, RHOAI | Developers exploring AI patterns |
| **Lifecycle** | Idea → Groomed → In Progress → Done | Outside scope |

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| gh-backlog-reader | Read, filter, or summarize the GitHub issues backlog |
| gh-issue-creator | Create new quickstart suggestion issues |
| pipeline-grooming | Groom, prioritize, or categorize the backlog |
| blog-writer | Generate blog post drafts for completed quickstarts |
| quickstart-identifier | Identify potential new quickstarts from trends and gaps |

## Skill Execution

### gh-backlog-reader
```bash
# Summary
python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py --summary
# All open issues
python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py
# Search
python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py --search "keyword"
# Closed/completed issues
python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py --state closed
# Full details
python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py --detail
# Filter by assignee
python3 core/skills/gh-backlog-reader/scripts/read_backlog.py --assignee username
```

### gh-issue-creator
```bash
# Always dry-run first
python3 core/skills/gh-issue-creator/scripts/create_issues.py --name "Name" --dry-run
# Create with metadata
python3 core/skills/gh-issue-creator/scripts/create_issues.py \
  --name "Name" --description "..." --technology "..." --industry "..."
```

### pipeline-grooming
Conversational. Read `core/skills/pipeline-grooming/SKILL.md` and `references/grooming-criteria.md`, then:
- Fetch the backlog with gh-backlog-reader
- Score each issue against the readiness rubric
- Produce a grooming report with gaps, coverage, and recommendations

### blog-writer
Conversational. Read `core/skills/blog-writer/SKILL.md`, `assets/blog-template.md`, and `references/messaging-guidelines.md`, then:
- Fetch the issue with `gh-backlog-reader --issue <N>` to get comments and linked repos
- If a linked implementation repo exists, browse its README to understand architecture and usage
- Generate a draft in `data/blog-drafts/{slug}-{date}.md`

### quickstart-identifier
Conversational. Read `core/skills/quickstart-identifier/SKILL.md` and `references/industry-trends.md`, then:
- Fetch current backlog with gh-backlog-reader
- Compare against industry and technology targets
- Propose new quickstarts with rationale

## Request Routing

| User Request | Route To |
|--------------|----------|
| "Show backlog" / "List issues" / "Backlog summary" | gh-backlog-reader |
| "Show my issues" / "Issues by [user]" | gh-backlog-reader --author username (or --assignee) |
| "Create issue" / "Add to backlog" / "Suggest quickstart" | gh-issue-creator |
| "Groom backlog" / "Prioritize" / "Categorize" | pipeline-grooming |
| "Write blog draft" / "Announce quickstart" | blog-writer |
| "Blog for issue #39" / "Write blog for this quickstart" | gh-backlog-reader --issue N → blog-writer (uses linked repo) |
| "Identify gaps" / "Coverage analysis" / "New quickstart ideas" | quickstart-identifier |
| "Check completed" / "What's done" / "Closed issues" | gh-backlog-reader --state closed |
| "Show issue #39" / "Details on issue 39" | gh-backlog-reader --issue 39 (includes comments + linked repos) |

## Output Directory

All generated artifacts (blog drafts, grooming reports, coverage analyses, etc.) go in `data/`:

```
data/
  blog-drafts/          ← Blog post drafts
  reports/              ← Grooming reports, coverage analyses
```

This directory is gitignored — nothing in `data/` gets pushed to the repo. Create subdirectories as needed.

## Governance

- **Business outcome required** before development
- Issues follow `[Quickstart suggestion]` template
- Blog posts reference catalog and repo
- **No API keys or credentials** in any artifacts
- **Blog posts:** drafts requiring review before publication

## Resource Sync

After creating or editing skills:

```bash
bash core/scripts/sync-clients.sh
```

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity first:** Make each change as simple as possible.
- **No laziness:** Find root causes; no temporary fixes; senior standards.
- **Minimal impact:** Changes should only touch what is necessary.
- **Verify before done:** Never mark a task complete without running real validation and reviewing output.
